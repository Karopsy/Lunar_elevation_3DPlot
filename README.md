To download the DEM from the LRO LOLA team, you can access it using the PDS node or else. 
I personnally downloaded it from the following website: https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/moon_lro_lola_dem_118m
which is a good enough accuracy when considering the entire surface. 

In the code, it allowas you to downsize it in order to make it more managable and less heavy for plotting and manipulating. 


Let me know if you have any questions/comments, I would be happy to hear them!
